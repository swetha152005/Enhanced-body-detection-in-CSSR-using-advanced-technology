**Project Title:**
Enhancing Body Detection in Collapsed Structure Search and Rescue (CSSR) Operations Using Advanced Technology

**Abstract / Description:**
This project aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of detecting human presence in disaster-stricken areas, especially in collapsed structures, using advanced embedded systems and sensor technologies. The system incorporates:

PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors to detect human body heat signatures.

Obstacle sensors to navigate through debris and tight spaces.

Arduino microcontroller to process sensor data and control robotic movement.

Wireless communication for real-time monitoring and coordination with rescue teams.

The system is mounted on a mobile robotic platform capable of navigating hazardous environments where human rescuers may be at risk. The collected data is transmitted to a control center to inform and assist decision-making in rescue operations.

**Key Features:**
Real-time human detection based on infrared radiation.

Obstacle avoidance for safe mobility in complex terrains.

Modular, low-cost design for deployment in large-scale disaster zones.

Potential integration with AI for pattern recognition and decision-making.
